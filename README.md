# HOME
Collection of simple '.' files for use with linux

A collection of things like .profile, .bashrc, .emacs, .screenrc, and
a few basic util scripts. I find it easier to keep these in a git
repo, then I can bootstrap myself in a new environment like this:

```
   % cd ~
   % rm -rf .??* *
   % git clone git@github.com:klash/HOME .
```
